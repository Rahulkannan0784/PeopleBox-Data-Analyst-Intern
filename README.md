# PeopleBox Data Analyst Intern

In this repository, I have included the transformation scripts and documentation for two exercises completed as part of the PeopleBox Data Analyst Internship. The exercises involve transforming employee data from a columnar format into a historical, row-based versioning format suitable for database storage.

## Exercise 1: Historical Employee Records Transformation
- **Objective**: Transform current employee data into a historical, row-based versioning format.
- **Input**: 'input.csv' containing employee data.
- **Output**: 'output.csv' containing transformed employee records.
- **Transformation Process**: Detailed documentation provided in the README.md file.
- **Google Colab**: You can also run this transformation process in Google Colab using the provided link.

## Exercise 2: Survey Response Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze a dataset from a survey response in a company.
- **Input**: Dataset with columns such as Employees (id, name, department, location, gender, age, and manager_id) and Responses (id, driver_name, score, and employee_id).
- **Output**: SQL queries to analyze the dataset and provide useful insights to the HR leader for action.
- **SQL Queries**: Detailed documentation and solution provided in the README.md file.

Feel free to explore the repository for more details on each exercise and the transformation process.
