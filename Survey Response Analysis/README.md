# Survey Response Analysis

This project involves the analysis of survey response data to provide useful insights to the HR leader for action.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two main tables:

1. **Employees**: Contains information about employees such as ID, name, department, location, gender, age, and manager ID.
2. **Responses**: Contains the responses to the survey, including the driver name, score, and employee ID.

You can view the schema and data using the [db-fiddle link](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/jQv1JemWTruj8iWHNhGgZe/155).

## Analysis Approach
1. **SQL Queries**: SQL queries were written to analyze the dataset and provide insights. The queries were executed using a MySQL database.

## Files
- `analysis.sql`: Contains the SQL queries used for analysis.
- `results.csv`: Contains the final results of the analysis.

## Google Sheet
The summarized results can be viewed in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Dwm3Sa25egSN35K76b9cliA2ikVnFeqykOyBc_cKMM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usage
1. Fork the db-fiddle using the provided [link](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/jQv1JemWTruj8iWHNhGgZe/155).
2. Add the SQL queries from `analysis.sql` to the forked db-fiddle.
3. Run the queries to generate the results.
4. Download the results as a CSV file (`results.csv`).
5. Use the insights from the analysis to inform HR actions.
